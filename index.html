<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

The purpose of the Johns Hopkins Robo Challenge is to complement classroom instruction by providing students with a unique opportunity to apply classroom skills and knowledge in a fun and competitive environment. The event brings students in teams to construct and program small robots that compete in several challenges.This competition is free and open to all middle and high school students.

Open Hours: March 15th, 2014 click (1-5pm) 
Description: Graduate student will be available to assist teachers and students one-on-one to help diagnose problems that teams may be facing with their robot. 
Location: Hackerman Hall B17, Johns Hopkins Homewood Campus (directions) 

JHRC Competition: April 5th, 2014 click (10am-5pm) 
Location: Johns Hopkins University Athletic Center (Directions) 
Register here by March 22.


This year we are coordinating with the Hopkins Robotics Cup to host both robotics events on the same day. For more information see their website.


<h3><a name="challenges" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Challenges</h3>

## Challenge 1: Slithering Slalom

[Major changes] Robots must follow a long, curvy black line on the ground. Obstacles will be placed parallel to the line, which the robot must avoid.

## Challenge 2: Mystery Maze

[Minor changes] Robots are placed in the Mystery Maze where they must autonomously navigate around corners and multi-way splits in attempts to reach the finish.

## Challenge 3: Microsurgical Search & Destroy

[Major changes] Teams of Robotic Eye Surgeons will design and program their robots to find and remove all the “lesions” (cups on large white circles) at various unknown locations in the patient’s eye, a 4’ x 4’ enclosure. Two teams will compete simultaneously to remove the most lesions.

## Challenge 4: Unleashing the Mad Scientist, Innovative Use of Board of Education

Teams will design an innovative and practical application for their robot beyond the scope of the ideas in the other challenges. They will display a working model of their idea in an oral presentation along with a written report.

## Challenge 5: So You Think Your Robot Can Dance

Teams will program an original dance routine for their robot(s). Choreography can include a combination of spins, repeated sequences, and other creative movements.



<h3><a name="general-rules" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General Rules</h3>

1) Robot programs must be written entirely by the student teams (but may receive input from mentors).

2) Teams may use portions of programs that they have previously written. However, they may not use programs that other people wrote or that were obtained by online resources.

3) Only robots that comply with the “Acceptable Robots” may be used for events 1-3. 4) There may not be more than 3 student members (Grades 6-12) on a team.

For a complete set of rules see the 2014 official PDF.


<h3><a name="robots" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Acceptable Robots</h3>

This year, there is a specific size limit for each robot competing in Challenges 1-3. This rule supersedes previous restrictions on which robots could be used. For the first three challenges the maximum width and length of the robot is 7.5 inches by 7.5 inches. Within reason, there is no size limit for challenges 4 and 5.

We are also removing previous restrictions on which sensors can be used. You can now use any sensor compatible with your robot kit.

Suggested robots:

Arduino-based robot
Sparki
BoE-Bot
Other options
We have a set of BoE-bots that can be loaned out for free (with $150 security deposit). If you would like a kit email us at jhurobocomp@gmail.com.
