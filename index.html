The 2018 Robo Challenge will take place on Saturday April 28, 2018 on the JHU Homewood campus. 
<br>
<!-- <div align="center"><img src="images/RC_schedule_2016.jpg" width="75%"/></div> -->

<h3><a name="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

The purpose of the Johns Hopkins Robo Challenge is to complement classroom instruction by providing students with a unique opportunity to apply classroom skills and knowledge in a fun and competitive environment. The event brings students in teams to construct and program small robots that compete in several challenges.This competition is free and open to all middle and high school students. <br>
<br>
<!-- <img src="" height="100"/>[insert poster] -->

An outline of the events and an abreviated set of rules is listed below. See the <b></b><a href="https://github.com/JHURoboChallenge/JHURoboChallenge.github.io/raw/master/pdfs/JHRC_2017_v1.0.pdf">official rules</a></b> for more details.
Note that there may be some minor changes between now and the training session. In addition we will upload scoring rubrics for each challenge and a list of parts to recreate each challenge so that teams can better prepare for the event.

<b> Challenge 1: Slithering Slalom </b><br>
Robots must follow a long, curvy black line on the ground. Obstacles will be placed parallel to the line, which the robot must avoid.

<br><br><b> Challenge 2: Mystery Maze </b><br>
Robots are placed in the Mystery Maze where they must autonomously navigate around corners and multi-way splits in attempts to reach the finish. Note: the maze will look different this year. We will also provide a list of parts so that teams can assemble a practice course at home.

<br><br><b> Challenge 3: Microsurgical Search & Destroy </b><br>

Teams of Robotic Eye Surgeons will design and program their robots to find and remove all the “lesions” (cups on large white circles) at various unknown locations in the patient’s eye, a 4’ x 4’ enclosure. Two teams will compete simultaneously to remove the most lesions.

<tr><td> <div align="left">
<br><br><b> Challenge 3: Shark Tank </b><br>
Shark Tank is an open ­ended challenge where each team must design and prototype an innovative application for their robot. Some previous examples include creating a miniature prototype prosthetic arm using Lego Mindstorms, an autonomous goalie for a soccer game, and a robot that can draw letters. Each team should demonstrate a working model to a group of judges who will ask questions regarding design, implementation, and the target application.

<tr><td> <div align="left">
<br><br><b> Challenge 4: So You Think Your Robot Can Dance </b><br>

Teams will program an original dance routine for their robot(s) that can last up to 2 minutes. Choreography can include a combination of spins, repeated sequences, and other creative movements.

<h3><a name="general-rules" class="anchor" href="#general-rules"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>General Rules</h3>

<ul>
<li> There can be a maximum of 3 middle/high school students per team
<li> Only robots that comply with the “Acceptable Robots” may be used for the Slalom and Maze.
<li> Robot programs must be written entirely by the student teams (but may receive help from mentors). Extensive use of outside code is prohibited.
</ul>

<!-- <ul>
<li>Robot programs must be written entirely by the student teams (but may receive input from mentors).</li>
<li>Teams may use portions of programs that they have previously written. However, they may not use programs that other people wrote or that were obtained by online resources.</li>
<li> Only robots that comply with the “Acceptable Robots” may be used for events 1-3.  </li>
<li> There may not be more than 3 student members (Grades 6-12) on a team. </li>
</ul> -->

For a complete set of rules see the official PDF above.


<h3><a name="robots" class="anchor" href="#robots"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Acceptable Robots</h3>

<p>
<!-- This year, there is a specific size limit for each robot competing in Challenges 1-3. This rule supersedes previous restrictions on which robots could be used. For the first three challenges the maximum width and length of the robot is 7.5 inches by 7.5 inches. Within reason, there is no size limit for challenges 4 and 5. -->
This year, there is a specific size limit for each robot competing in the Slithering Slalom and Mystery Maze but not for the Shark Tank or Dance. For these challenges the maximum width and length of the robot is  7.5 inches by 7.5 inches . Within reason, there is no size limit for the other challenges.  For most challenges the speed of the robot will be a factor in the score.
You can use any sensor compatible with your robot kit.

Suggested robots:
<ul>
<li> Arduino-based robot </li>
<li> Sparki </li>
<li> Lego Mindstorms </li>
<li> BoE-Bot </li>
